## MakerDAO Technical Deepdive

MakerDAO is currently the #2 DeFi protocol by TVL, and this is with them only opertaing on the Ethereum blockchain. The main reason I chose to look into MakerDAO before Lido (the #1 protocol by Tvl) is due to my personal interest in DAI, which is the most used decentralised stablecoin that's soft pegged to the US dollar.
